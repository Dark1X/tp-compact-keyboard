Thinkpad Multi-Connect Keyboard
===============================

There is also another physically-identical keyboard, the Thinkpad
*Multi-Connect* Keyboard, which allows you to toggle between 3 paired devices.

It appears to be China-only, and only available through sites like AliExpress.
There are no drivers for any OS (iOS/Android or Windows), just a single-sheet
manual is available here:

Unlike the Compact keyboards, the keyboard does not have (known) built-in
Fn-Lock functions, Fn, Fn-F1 and F1 are all separate scancodes, so they can be
remapped using a ``hwdb`` database.
