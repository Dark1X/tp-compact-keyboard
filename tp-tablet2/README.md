Thinkpad Tablet 2 Keyboard
==========================

Older than the compact keyboards the above, it was sold with the Tablet 2 and has a fold-out stand
for said tablet.

It doesn't have a trackpoint, rather a Blackberry-esque tiny trackpad which you
use like a trackball.

Dissassembly
------------

* Unclip the frame around the keyboard, the power slider just pokes the real button underneath.
* Undo the 4 screws holding the keyboard down (including the tri-wing screw with ground connection)
* Gently pry the keyboard from the metal backing plate it's glued to
  * The keyboard ribbon cable loops around underneath the trackpoint buttons, don't pry there
  * The trackpoint ribbon is underneath the trackpoint
  * Do **not** pry the backing plate away from the bottom plastic, whilst some screws are visible and it looks like it will come off that way, there are more screws underneath the keyboard.q
* Undo all the metal backing plate screws.
