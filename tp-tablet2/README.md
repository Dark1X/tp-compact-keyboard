Thinkpad Tablet 2 Keyboard
==========================

Older than the compact keyboards the above, it was sold with the Tablet 2 and has a fold-out stand
for said tablet.

It doesn't have a trackpoint, rather a Blackberry-esque tiny trackpad which you
use like a trackball.

Dissassembly
------------

* Unclip the frame around the keyboard, the power slider just pokes the real button underneath.
* Undo the 4 screws holding the keyboard down (including the tri-wing screw with ground connection)
* Gently pry the keyboard from the metal backing plate it's glued to, remove 2 keyboard ribbon cables. Do not pry the backing plate away from the bottom plastic.
* Undo all the metal backing plate screws.
